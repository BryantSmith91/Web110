<!-- Your course contract (and all pages from now on) should include:
    •	A title that includes your name, the course id, and the name of this page, with some kind of separator.
    •	Proper html components including html, head, meta, title, and body tags.
    •	Additional header, main, and footer elements in that order
    •	Your name and course ID in the header as an h1
    •	The name of the page at the top of the main element as an h2.
    •	Type the following four paragraphs within the main element, changing the generic items to your specific situation:
    I, FirstName M. LastName agree to abide by the terms in my NameOfSemester ABC123-99 Name of this Course with my instructor, Preferred Name of Instructor.
    I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
    I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as an absences.
    Signed: FirstName M. LastName, DD Month YYYY
    •	In the first line of your contract where you put your name, make the text link to a file called introduction.html (which may not exist yet- though you can get started on that if you like). 
    •	Make up an imaginary design company that you run and add the text "Page built by YourCompanyName" or something like that into the footer.
    •	Within the footer include links and validation images to validate the html and the css. 
    •	Upload your contract to your folder for this course, and in this forum make a new post that includes your name in the subject line, and provide a clickable link to your webspace
    •	 Use these validation buttons. Be sure the links go AROUND them. Use height of 31 and width of 88.   
    •	The links to use are:
    o	href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer"
    o	href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer"
