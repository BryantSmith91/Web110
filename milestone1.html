                        The purpose of this webpage is to establish an informational series of pages to help people learn about Data Analytics and some resources for Data Analytics.

                        The intended audience for this website is for anyone who is interested in learning more about the world of Data Analytics. This includes being able to provide information and challenges for people who have varying levels of knowledge and skills in computer
                        programming and Data Analytics.

                    <li class=indent>
                        I envision a variety of different content being offered on this website. I would like to offer services or information for people of all skill levels of data analytics. Some services I can imagine for this webpage is a tutorial section for using Python,
                        Tableau, PowerBI, or Excel for entry level Data Analytics. I can also add a section of this website providing Python Programming challenges or for people to practice and hone thier skills. The webpage can also have a section for
                        a blog that covers a variety of different Data Analytics topics, such as new developments in Data Analytics or possibly some lesser-known python extensions that can be useful in Data Analytics or learning programming. Or finally,
                        a community section where people can comment or ask questions about Data Science where either myself or some other members of the community can help answer the questions.
