        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal background:</strong> Born and raised in New York, about an hour outside of NYC. Moved to NC in 2014 with my family and celebrating recently getting engaged and moving in with my fianc√©e </li>
            <li><strong>Academic background:</strong> Bachelor's in Criminology from John Jay College of Criminal Justice in NYC, Completed UNCC/Trilogy Education Data Analysis Boot Camp, Attending CPCC with a goal of an Associates in Database Development.</li>
            <li><strong>Professional background:</strong> I've got a long history in the retail space, specifically grocery where I worked for nearly 6 years in a grocery store in New York and then 3 years in a Publix after moving to NC. Prior to moving to
                NC I was in charge of the routes for a selection of techs with the cable company Mediacom. After leaving Publix I began to work for Lowe's Home Improvement in their corporate offices in Mooresville where I just recently changed positions
                to an Analyst role.</li>
            <li><strong>Background in the subject matter of this course:</strong> I received exposure to HTML, CSS, and Javascript while in my Data Analysis Boot Camp. I've got a solid base understanding of the three languages, but could definitely use more
                instruction and would like to eventually finish my personal webpage.</li>
            <li><strong>Primary computer platform:</strong> Windows 10 at home and work. (Custom Built PC, that's a few years old and Work PC is a Surface Laptop)</li>
            <li><strong>Reason for taking each course:</strong><br>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>WEB 110-85:</strong> Fundamentals of Internet/Web Technologies - Mostly for my degree, but also looking to learn more and get a more solid understanding of Web Technologies.</li>
                    <li>My Course contract can be accessed <a href=contract.html>here.</a></li>
                    <li><strong>CSC 143-91:</strong> Object Oriented Programming - Again, mostly for my degree but looking to expand my knowledge of Object Oriented Programming as my knowledge of Python is at more of an analytical level as opposed to a programming
                        level.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Funny story or interesting item about yourself to remember you by:</strong> Through my time in the cable industry and at Lowe's, I know way more about networking and window treatments than I ever had a desire to know.</li>
                <li><strong>I'd also like to share:</strong> I spend a little too much of my downtime watching YouTube videos or streams on Twitch.tv, even more so now that I've been working from home.</li>
