<!-- o	List the working title of each page on your website. Be sure to include a page that contains a form. See next item for details. -->
<!-- o	Forms will be discussed in chapter 9. Forms are generally used to collect information (visitor's contact info, order on a commercial website, etc.). One of your working pages above should include a form page. Indicate what type of data you will ask the user to enter into the form. -->

            <h3>My Website's Goal</h3>
            <hr class=sep>
            <p>The goal of my website is going to be twofold. I would like this website to be an informative place for people to learn more about the python programming language. I would also like this webpage to be somewhere for people to share their knowledge
                of python, other programming languages, and data science methods.</p>
            <hr class=sec>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div id=workingtitles>
            <hr class=sec>
            <h3>Website Use Cases or Page Ideas</h3>
            <hr class=sep>
            <div id=listoftitles>

            </div>

            <p>At the end of the day, I would like to be able to create a webpage that would serve multiple functions.</p>
            <p><strong>Blog:</strong> I would like this website to have a blog to begin with. The blog could easily have a form on it to add comments from readers.</p>
            <p><strong>Tutorials:</strong> Another page that I would like to have on this site is a page of code tutorials, or step-by-step guides on how to do some basic tasks in the python environment.</p>
            <p><strong>Project Ideas:</strong> A third idea for pages on this website would be a section of project ideas, this would differ from the step-by-step guides because it might not offer the solution right away. Here, we could use a form to accept
                submissions for solutions from readers and post some solutions to the blog section of the webpage.</p>
            <p><strong>Forums:</strong> A future-state goal of this webpage would also be to include a web forum or some sort of chat functionality, in order for the readers to communicate with eachother and form a community to help each-other grow as well
                as support each other.</p>

            <hr class=sec>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div id=forms>
            <hr class=sec>
            <h3>Further discussion about Forms.</h3>
            <hr class=sep>
            <p>So, as said above, a couple of potential forms I could use on this webpage are as follows:<br><br> I could use one form on the webpage for comments, realistically on any section of the website. This allows for the commuinity to interact with
                each other.<br><br> Another possible use of forms on this page is to intake submissions on the project suggestions page. Here the forms could be used to intake submissions or share submissions with other members of a community. </p>
            <hr class=sec>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div id=information>
            <hr class=sec>
            <h3>What information would I need for this website and where would I obtain this information?</h3>
            <hr class=sep>
            <p>The information needed for this website is going to be vastly different based on the page you're looking on. <br><br>On the Blog and Tutorials sections I'm going to need information from the documentation, be it python documentation or the
                documentation for the python extension. In these sections I can also get some information from experties in their fields of Data Science, people who know what the field currently looks like or have an idea on where the field will be heading
                in the next few years.<br><br>For the projects section I can compile questions and scenarios from various textbooks.</p>
